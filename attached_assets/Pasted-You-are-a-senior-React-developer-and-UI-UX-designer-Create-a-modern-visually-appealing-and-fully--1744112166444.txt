You are a senior React developer and UI/UX designer. Create a modern, visually appealing, and fully responsive React website for a show called “Ready Set StartUP UK.” Use React (with functional components and hooks), Tailwind CSS for styling, and other helpful libraries like React Router (for navigation) and Framer Motion (for animations).
